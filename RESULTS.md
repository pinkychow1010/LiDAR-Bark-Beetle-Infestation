#### Here the results of the study are briefly presented:

**1) Dead-Tree Pixel Inspection**

➤ NDVI are generally very high in the study plot and no dead-tree pixels found

**2) NDVI - LAI**

➤ LAI and NDVI are generally in good agreement

**3) LAI Saturation**

➤ For NDVI over 0.7, there is no noticeable relationship between NDVI and LAI

**4) Relative LAI to tree height**

➤ Healthy and unhealthy trees might be distinguished by comparing the ratio of LAI and tree height (given the same tree species).

**5) LAI Statistics**

➤ Apart from pixels with no trees, the average LAI for all pixels are approximately 2-3, with a peak at 2.

**6) Differences among health groups**

➤ For different health groups, there can be seen differences in both NDVI and LAI.
